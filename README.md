# AI-Driven-Border-Security-and-Strategic-Management-System

This project introduces an AI-Driven Border Security System designed to enhance real-time surveillance and threat detection. The system integrates cutting-edge deep learning models and classical computer vision techniques to ensure robust performance in complex border environments.  

YOLOv8 serves as the core object detection model, specializing in identifying and classifying critical entities such as individuals and weapons from live video streams with high efficiency. Haar Cascade is employed for face detection, while Local Binary Pattern Histogram (LBPH) is utilized for facial recognition, ensuring accurate identification of individuals. Additionally, OSNet-based re-identification is incorporated to track and identify individuals across multiple cameras, enabling seamless monitoring even in multi-camera setups.  

The models are trained and fine-tuned using a custom-curated dataset, annotated through Roboflow, to achieve optimal performance in real-world scenarios. The system integrates with IP Webcam, enabling real-time multi-camera feeds to provide comprehensive border coverage.  

Performance evaluation employs metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, along with detailed precision-recall curves and confusion matrices. Results indicate outstanding accuracy and reliability, showcasing the systemâ€™s capability to detect, classify, and re-identify individuals effectively.  

Future enhancements will focus on extending the system's capabilities to include behavior analysis and anomaly detection, further solidifying its role as an indispensable tool for border security and national safety.
